  quokka: An Interactive File Renamer
  ===================================

  quokka is an interactive file renamer, which helps to rename multiple files
  in a systematic manner. It provides a set of rules, for example, changing
  extensions, inserting a string into file names, replacing a certain sequence
  with a new one and so on. You can combine these rules as you want by adding
  them into the rule chain. Editing each rule and the rule chain is performed
  interactively as you do in a shell prompt. The following, for example, shows
  how to rename files' extensions to `.node' using quokka:

    > extension
    entering `extension'

    extension> change to node
    file extensions will change to `node'

    extension> preview
    files will be renamed as follows when you type `done' and `rename'
    ------------------------------------------------------------------
    ./global.js    | ./global.node
    ./mycolors.js  | ./mycolors.node
    ./validator.js | ./validator.node
    ./wcwidth.js   | ./wcwidth.node

    extension> done
    files will be renamed as follows when you type `rename'
    -------------------------------------------------------
    ./global.js    | ./global.node
    ./mycolors.js  | ./mycolors.node
    ./validator.js | ./validator.node
    ./wcwidth.js   | ./wcwidth.node

    > rename
    files are being renamed
    ----------------------
    ./global.js    | ./global.node    [ok]
    ./mycolors.js  | ./mycolors.node  [ok]
    ./validator.js | ./validator.node [ok]
    ./wcwidth.js   | ./wcwidth.node   [ok]

    4 files successfully renamed
    you need to `reset' file list and rules after `rename'

    > exit

  where the `>' indicates a quokka's prompt and `extension' before it does the
  user is editing the `extension' rule. Typing `help' shows what commands
  quokka accepts in general and in a specific rule mode.

  Even if its source code contains some stuff realted to MS Windows, it
  currently supports and is tested only for UNIX-like environments. For now,
  nothing was guranteed for MS Windows.

  INSTALL explains how to build (in fact, there is no build process for node.js
  applications) and install quokka. For the copyright issues, see the
  accompanying LICENSE file.

  Among libraries used, alphanum.js has been modified to meet quokka's needs;
  it has been modified to behave in a more similar way to `ls -v' and to return
  the sorted array instead of nothing. If you need to replace that module with,
  say, a updated one, it is necessary to apply these changes properly.
