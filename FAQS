  Frequently Asked Questions for quokka
  =====================================

  -- What does the `-v' option do?

  It makes quokka to behave in the same way as `ls -v' when sorting file names;
  it affects how numbers in file names are handled. Without the option, quokka
  performs lexicographic comparison which puts, say, `img10' before `img2'
  because `1' has a smaller code than `2' has. This looks natural to most (if
  not all) programmers, but ordinary users would like to put `10' after `2'
  which the `-v' option exactly does.


  -- Is there a way to control the order in which files are sorted?

  quokka can also accepts file names to rename from the contents of a file
  given through the -f option. For example, you can edit the file obtained
  from `ls -t -1 > list.txt' (where the `-t' for sorting by modification time
  and `-1' for displaying only file names) and give it to quokka with the `-f'
  option.


  -- Can I run only one command at a time?

  No. quokka is designed to accept multiple commands in a line. For example,
  you can change files' extensions to `docx' by this one-line input:

    > #extension change to docx done rename

  instead of:

    > #extension
    #extension> change to docx
    [... output snipped ...]
    #extension> done
    [... output snipped ...]
    > rename
    [... output snipped ...]

  The thing is that the newline character does not differ from other
  whitespaces in separating commands. Of course, the auto-completion by
  pressing the Tab key always works based on the current mode indicated by the
  prompt, which means pressing the Tab key does not give you "change to" after
  `#extension' typed above.


  -- How can I input a single text that contains spaces?

  Simple. Just quote it.
