  How To Build and Install quokka
  ===============================

  This package does not provide an automated way to build or install the program
  because quokka runs on top of node.js that is a javascript interpreter (if you
  want to know more about node.js, visit http://nodejs.org). The simplest way to
  use quokka is just to run it using node.js as follows:

    $ node quokka.js <files-to-rename>

  where the `$' indicates a user prompt.

  In a Unix-like environment, it would be more convenient to put a shell script
  that runs quokka into a directory like /usr/bin or /usr/local/bin.
